# BabylonJS + CoffeeScript + Browserify + LiveReload Development Boilerplate

It's a very simple boilerplate for Babylonjs.

## Installation

To start using Phaser with CoffeeScript easily,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/selenologist/babylon-coffee-boilerplate my-game
cd my-game
npm start
```

## main.coffee

main.coffee is your main file. You should write your game's HTML presentational parts here. Since this boilerplate uses **browserify**
you can/should use `require` function of Node.js easily. TL,DR; it's main file.


Have fun! :)
